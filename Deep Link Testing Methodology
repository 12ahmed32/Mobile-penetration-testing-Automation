deep link -> apps have priority over browser to handle it , hijackable unless signature level protection 
web link -> if android < 12 apps same deep link with just http/https scheme hijackable if android > 12 browser handle it ( possible bypass if the app support old sdk run emulator with android < 12 ) 
app link -> web link with autoverify if implemented correct it is safe if not it just web link , do the same test process as web link check if the app support android < 12 prepare emulator and try to make your poc app intercept the link
so we make our poc app and trigger the link or send an intent via adb for speed
